# Spatial-Statistics-and-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code that I wrote as part of the course Spatial Statistics and Machine Learning (Utrecht University, 2021). The aim was to analyse spatial data using (1) linear regression models, (2) Random Forest (including boosting), and (3) Decision Trees.
